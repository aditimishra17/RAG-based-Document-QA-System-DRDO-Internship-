# RAG-based-Document-QA-System-DRDO-Internship-
Command-line Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built during DRDO internship. Uses FAISS, LangChain, and open-source LLMs to answer queries from structured military PDFs.
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to answer queries from military mission reports.
It combines semantic search with a large language model (LLM) to provide accurate, context-aware answers.
Built as part of the Young Scientist program, this project demonstrates the integration of vector search and open-source LLMs for domain-specific Q&A.

Features
Semantic Search using SentenceTransformers embeddings.
Fast Vector Retrieval with FAISS.
CLI-based interaction for a lightweight, fast interface.
Open-source LLM integration (DeepSeek)
Domain-specific knowledge from real-world mission reports.

Tech Stack
Python 3.10+
SentenceTransformers – for generating embeddings.
FAISS – for vector similarity search.
Transformers / open-source LLM – for generating answers.
CLI Interface – for user interaction.
