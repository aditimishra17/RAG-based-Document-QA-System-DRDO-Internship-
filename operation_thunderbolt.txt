Operation Entebbe, also known as Operation Thunderbolt, was a successful counter-terrorist hostage-rescue mission carried out by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) at Entebbe Airport in Uganda on July 4, 1976. The operation was a response to the hijacking of Air France Flight 139, which was en route from Tel Aviv to Paris via Athens.
The plane involved, Airbus A300B4-203 at Paris – Charles de Gaulle (Roissy) (CDG / LFPG), France, September 6 1980.
The Hijacking
On June 27, 1976, Air France Flight 139 was hijacked by two members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – External Operations (PFLP-EO) and two members of the German Revolutionary Cells. The hijackers diverted the flight to Benghazi, Libya, for refueling before heading to Entebbe, Uganda. At Entebbe, the hijackers were joined by additional terrorists and supported by Ugandan dictator Idi Amin. They demanded the release of 40 Palestinians held in Israel and 13 other detainees incarcerated in Kenya, France, Switzerland, and Germany. They threatened to kill the hostages if their demands were not met by July 1.
Hostage Conditions
Upon arrival at Entebbe, the hostages were held in the old terminal of the airport. The terrorists released a significant number of hostages, keeping only those who were Israeli or of Jewish descent, about 106 in total. The separation and detention of Jewish passengers emphasized the anti-Semitic nature of the hijacking and heightened the urgency of the rescue mission for Israel.
Planning the Operation
The Israeli government, led by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, initially pursued diplomatic efforts but also began preparing a military response. Detailed intelligence was gathered, including information from released hostages and the Israeli Mossad. The plan, primarily developed by Major General Yekutiel Adam and Brigadier General Dan Shomron, was to carry out a surprise raid on Entebbe Airport.
The Raid
The mission, launched on July 3, involved a 90-member elite commando unit known as Sayeret Matkal. The team flew from Israel to Uganda, a distance of approximately 4,000 kilometers, in Hercules C-130 transport planes. Upon arrival, the commandos used a black Mercedes and Land Rovers to resemble Idi Amin’s motorcade, facilitating their approach to the terminal without arousing suspicion.

Sayeret Matkal is an elite special forces unit of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), known for its high-risk intelligence-gathering, counter-terrorism operations, and hostage rescue missions. Established in 1957, the unit is highly secretive and recruits only the most physically and mentally fit soldiers.
The assault commenced at midnight. The commandos swiftly engaged and neutralized the terrorists in the terminal, killing all the hijackers and several Ugandan soldiers who attempted to intervene. Within approximately 60 minutes, they secured the hostages, who were then flown back to Israel. Three hostages died during the rescue, and one, Dora Bloch, who had been taken to a hospital before the raid, was later killed by Ugandan forces.
Aftermath and Impact
The operation resulted in the rescue of 102 hostages. The only Israeli military casualty was the mission’s commander, Lieutenant Colonel Yonatan “Yoni” Netanyahu, who was killed during the assault. His death added a poignant layer to the mission’s legacy.

Lieutenant Colonel Netanyahu was an Israeli military officer. Born on March 13, 1946, in New York City, Yoni was the eldest brother of Benjamin Netanyahu, who later became the Prime Minister of Israel. He grew up in Israel, showing early promise in both academics and military leadership, eventually joining the elite Sayeret Matkal unit. Yoni's bravery and strategic acumen were evident throughout his military career.
Operation Entebbe had significant geopolitical ramifications. It demonstrated Israel’s military prowess and its commitment to protecting its citizens, garnering admiration worldwide. It also strained Israel-Uganda relations, eventually contributing to Idi Amin’s fall from power in 1979. The operation became a model for future counter-terrorism and hostage-rescue missions globally, showcasing the effectiveness of surprise, precision, and intelligence in military operations.
