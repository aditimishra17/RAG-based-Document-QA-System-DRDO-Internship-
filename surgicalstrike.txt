A surgical strike is a military attack aimed to damage only a legitimate military target with minimal collateral damage to surrounding structures, vehicles, buildings, or civilians in the vicinity. It is a precise, well-planned attack carried out with the objective of neutralising specific threats without waging a full-scale war. Such operations are usually executed with stealth, speed, and accuracy, often involving special forces or elite units trained for high-risk missions.

One of the most widely known surgical strikes in recent Indian military history is the 2016 Indian surgical strike across the Line of Control (LoC) in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. This operation was carried out by the Indian Army in response to the Uri attack that took place on 18 September 2016, where four heavily armed terrorists attacked an Indian Army brigade headquarters near the town of Uri in Jammu and Kashmir, resulting in the death of 19 Indian soldiers.

On 29 September 2016, the Indian Army conducted surgical strikes targeting multiple terrorist launch pads across the LoC. According to Indian government statements, the operation was planned and executed by the Indian Army’s Para Special Forces (Para SF) units, involving teams crossing the LoC under cover of darkness, carrying out direct attacks on these launch pads, and returning safely without any casualties on their side. The operation was conducted between midnight and dawn, with meticulous coordination between intelligence agencies, the Army, and the political leadership.

The planning phase included detailed intelligence gathering on the location of terror launch pads. Surveillance drones and satellites were used to map out the exact positions, strength, and movements of the militants and their handlers. The Para SF commandos underwent mission-specific training, including rehearsals on mock targets replicating the launch pads’ layouts.

On the day of the operation, Indian artillery conducted small-scale diversionary shelling to divert attention. Special Forces teams infiltrated approximately 1-3 km across the LoC at multiple points, targeting launch pads in areas such as Bhimber, Hotspring, Kel, and Lipa sectors. The teams were armed with assault rifles, grenade launchers, thermal imaging equipment, and explosives to destroy the launch pads.

According to Indian Army briefings, the strike inflicted significant casualties on the militants and their handlers, destroying their infrastructure. The teams completed the mission before dawn and returned to Indian territory without any injury. Following the operation, the Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) of India held a press briefing to announce the success of the strike, emphasising that it was a preemptive measure to neutralise terrorist threats planning attacks against India.

The strike held strategic, political, and psychological significance. Strategically, it demonstrated India’s capability and willingness to carry out cross-border precision attacks without escalating to a full-scale war. Politically, it showcased decisive leadership and a robust counter-terror policy. Psychologically, it impacted terrorist organisations operating in PoK and their backers, signalling that India would no longer tolerate terror launch pads across the border.

Pakistan denied that any surgical strike took place, claiming instead that it was cross-border firing. However, India maintained its position with official statements and international diplomatic outreach to assert its right to self-defence against imminent threats. Analysts argue that while Pakistan’s denial was expected to save face domestically and internationally, the strike nonetheless compelled them to shift and re-evaluate terror launch pad positions for a period following the operation.

The international reaction was mixed. Several countries called for restraint and urged India and Pakistan to avoid escalation. The United States, United Kingdom, Russia, and France condemned the Uri attack and supported India’s right to counter-terrorism, while also urging both countries to maintain stability in South Asia.

The 2016 surgical strike also triggered strategic and tactical discussions within Indian defence circles. It underlined the importance of having modern equipment, real-time intelligence, high-altitude warfare capability, and trained special operations forces. It prompted policy initiatives to enhance border infrastructure, surveillance systems, and quick response mechanisms along the LoC.

In the aftermath, the Indian Army and government emphasised their zero-tolerance policy against terrorism, asserting that any provocation would be met with measured, proportionate, and effective response. Defence analysts noted that surgical strikes are options between diplomatic protests and full-scale war, giving a nation operational flexibility to punish and deter aggressors without triggering uncontrollable escalation.

Apart from the 2016 strike, India has historically conducted similar limited cross-border raids. For instance, in 2015, Indian Army carried out an operation in Myanmar against Naga insurgents after attacks on Indian soldiers in Manipur, eliminating several militants in their camps. However, the 2016 strike was significant because it was the first officially announced cross-LoC strike against Pakistan-administered territory in recent times, marking a doctrinal shift from strategic restraint to assertive deterrence.

In 2019, following the Pulwama attack, India again demonstrated its proactive approach through the Balakot airstrike, where Indian Air Force fighter jets crossed the LoC and struck a Jaish-e-Mohammed training camp deep inside Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. This was an aerial strike rather than ground-based surgical strike but followed the same principle of precise, limited objective without intending full-scale war.

The concept of surgical strike is not unique to India. Globally, special operations forces conduct such missions to achieve quick, decisive results against high-value targets while minimising collateral damage. For example, the US Navy SEAL operation to eliminate Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan in 2011 was a surgical strike executed with similar doctrines of secrecy, precision, and speed.

However, surgical strikes carry risks of escalation if discovered or if they result in unintended casualties. Therefore, political clearance, military capability, and diplomatic management are critical pillars for such operations. They require synchronisation between intelligence, planning, execution, and post-operation communication.

In Indian military doctrine, surgical strikes have now become part of sub-conventional warfare options under its Cold Start Doctrine, giving flexibility for limited, swift, and targeted retaliation to terror provocations without crossing nuclear thresholds or triggering prolonged conflict.

In conclusion, surgical strikes are precise military operations aimed at eliminating threats swiftly and with minimal collateral damage. The 2016 Indian surgical strike across the LoC demonstrated India’s growing counter-terror capabilities, political resolve, and special forces’ operational readiness to execute complex missions in hostile territory, shaping India’s defence policy and strategic posture in the subcontinent for future deterrence and security.
